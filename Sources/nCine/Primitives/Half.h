			@brief Half-precision float literal

			Represents a floating-point value in the `binary16` [format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-precision_floating-point_format).

			The sole purpose of this type is to make creation, conversion and visualization
			of half-float values easier. By design it doesn't support any arithmetic
			operations as not all CPU architecture have native support for half-floats and
			thus the operations would be done faster in a regular single-precision @cpp float @ce.

			The class provides explicit conversion from and to @cpp float @ce,
			equality comparison with correct treatment of NaN values, promotion and
			negation operator, a @link Literals::operator""_h() @endlink literal.
